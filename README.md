This project allows you to authenticate against RTM (RememberTheMilk.com) and using the return auth_token for the future actions.
You do NOT need to pass anything manually between the browser and your Ruby app.

You must go to RTM's site and request your application to have a callback (in my example it is /rtm)

This app is based on Sinatra.

Enjoy!
